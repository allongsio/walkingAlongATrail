- Time spent on the assignment : 12h

- Areas for improvement :

1. Depending on the type of device, arrow icons sometimes overlap each other, which causes a bad user experience. I want to improve this more intuitively.

2. When the mobile device was laid horizontally, the area of the scene might be excessively reduced due to the browser's interface, including the url area or the browser tab area, so I felt the need to distribute it to PWA.

3. I feel the need to improve using Ionic Framework because I haven't been able to use it.
